A driver to parse textile noweb files with Sweave tool

A driver to parse textile noweb files with Sweave tool
This driver parses textile files containing R code and replace pieces of
code with their output.

\note{
In order to work properly, noweb codes have to be located at the
beginning of a line (no indentation).

Compare with RweaveLatex driver, RweaveTextile provides one new option :
\code{format} to choose the format of figure that will be inserted in the
final document.

In addition, \code{cache} option from \code{weaver}
package is also available with \code{weaverTextile} driver.

A wrapper for \code{Sweave} can be used, named \code{Textile}.
